Graph

    - It is an intuitive Data Structure.
    - It is a network of nodes.

    - Basic Terminology:
        - Each Node is known as vertex (plural form vertices).
        - The line of connection is known edges.
    
    - Application of Graphs
        - Maps
        - Social Network
        - Delivery Network
    
    - Vertex: All the nodes are present in graph.
    - Edge: Connection b/w edges
        - Uni-Directional
        - Bi-Directional
    
    - Directed Graph: Graph where all edges are directional in known as Directed graph.
    - UnDirected Graph: Graph where all edges are non-directional in known as UnDirected graph.
    - Weighted Graph : Weight of the edge has been specified (Associated with edge).

    - Representation of Graph in memory: 
        -- Adjacency List
        -- Adjacency Matrix
        -- Edge List
        -- 2D Matrix (Implicit Graphs)
    
    - Adjacency List: Layman terms "List of Lists"
        - From one vertex the other vertex you can reach is known as neighbor in graph.
        - Implementation in Coding: Array of ArrayList.
        - We can make it with Vertices Array of ArrayList
        - We can make it with edge 
            static class Edge{
                int src;
                int dest;
                Edge(int src,int dest){
                    this.src=src;
                    this.dest=dest;
                }
            }
            ArrayList<Edge> graph[V]
            
            graph[0].add(new Edge(0,2));
            graph[1].add(new Edge(1,2));
            graph[1].add(new Edge(1,3));
