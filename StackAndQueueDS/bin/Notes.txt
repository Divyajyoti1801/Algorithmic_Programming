STACK AND QUEUE NOTES

    - Stack data structure
    - LIFO (Last in First out)
    - Important Function:
        - Push O(1) //Insertion 
        - Pop O(1) // Deleting 
        - Peek O(1) // Value of first element
    
    - Implementation
        - Array (Last index must be treated as Top of the stack)
            - stack full condition (no. of el == n) //Not usually used
        - ArrayList // Variable sized very much used 
        - LinkedList // Same for linked list and also used 
            - head creation
            - new element added it will become head;

    
    - QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE
        - FIFO (First In First Out)
        - Operations
            - Enque : Add the element
            - Dequeue : Removing the element
            - Front : Peek
        - Implementation
            - Queue using Array (Fixed Size) (Front=-1,Rear=-1)
                -- Add O(1)
                -- Remove O(n)  
                -- Peek O(n)
            - Circular Queue using array is really efficient.
                -- Add O(1)
                -- Remove O(1)
                -- Peek O(1)
                - Rear = (Rear+1) % size; //Very important statement for circular queue implementation
                - (Rear+1)%size == front // Circular Queue is full.
