STACK AND QUEUE NOTES

    - Stack data structure
    - LIFO (Last in First out)
    - Important Function:
        - Push O(1) //Insertion 
        - Pop O(1) // Deleting 
        - Peek O(1) // Value of first element
    
    - Implementation
        - Array (Last index must be treated as Top of the stack)
            - stack full condition (no. of el == n) //Not usually used
        - ArrayList // Variable sized very much used 
        - LinkedList // Same for linked list and also used 
            - head creation
            - new element added it will become head;
